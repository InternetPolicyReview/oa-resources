# Open Access Resources

This is a collection of resources aimed at small open access journals. It was begun and is maintained by the [Internet Policy Review](https://policyreview.info), an open access journal focusing on internet regulation.

The project should be seen as a living document.

## Projects

The Internet Policy Review offers a number of resources. While each of these can be used in alone, they also integrate with one another.

Formatting Automation (coming soon)
